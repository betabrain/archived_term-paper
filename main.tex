\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Hi there, this is a test. Today is the \today, and I this is working
somewhat \cite{liu2005maximizing}. There is so much more\footnote{And more.}
to say, but of course, let's not forget about the awesome work done
in \cite{cutler2001pert}.

\section{Random Forests}

\subsection{Machine Learning}

\subsubsection{Life Cycle}
Here I'll discuss the difference between machine learning and traditional
statistical methods. Terminology.

\subsubsection{Classification}
The classification problem. Terminology.

\subsubsection{Regression}
A short discussion of regression, the why and how, and the difference
between classical regression and regression in machine learning.
Terminology.

\subsubsection{Randomness}
Warn about fluctuations in modell outputs. Seeds.

\subsection{Ensembles}
A short introduction to ensembles and their properties. Terminology.
Weak and strong learners.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}
Sampling the data.

\subsubsection{Random Subspaces}
Sampling the variables.

\subsection{Classifiers}

\subsubsection{Decision Trees}
This is the basis.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy Trees}
...but trees can be more than simple trees.

\subsection{Putting them together}

\subsubsection{Random Forests}
Breiman

\subsubsection{Alternative: Dynamic Random Forests}
Boosting random forests.

\subsubsection{Alternative: Rotation Forest}
Massaging features before growing trees.

\subsubsection{Parameters and Biases}

\subsubsection{Alternative: PERT}
Random variables and random splits.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Selection of Papers}
PsychARTICLES, PsychINFO, Google Scholar

\section{Conclusion}
State of the art? Not really. They are not yet properly understood, and
many comparisons and lots of the advantages might be accidential.
Strong dependance on parameters, with no rationally pleasing way to set them.

\subsection{The End}
Bye.
